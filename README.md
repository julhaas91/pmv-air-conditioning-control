# pmv-air-conditioning-control

This repository contains code and documentation of a project related to PMV (Predicted Mean Vote) based air conditioning control as part of my masters program. 

## About

PMV is an index that predicts the mean value of the votes of a large group of people on a seven-point thermal sensation scale. This project likely explores the application of PMV in controlling air conditioning systems for improved thermal comfort and energy efficiency.

## Contents

The repository includes the following:

*   `code/`: This directory contains the source code for the air conditioning control system.  Based on the language statistics, it is primarily written in Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) with some Python (`.py`) components.
*   `paper/`: This directory likely contains research papers, reports, or documentation related to the project.
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
*   `LICENSE`: Contains the MIT license information.
*   `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
